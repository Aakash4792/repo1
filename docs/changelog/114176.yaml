  title: "[Inference API] Deprecate task_settings, renamed to parameters"
  area: REST API
  details: In 8.16 the inference API is renaming the `task_settings` component of inference endpoints (used in the Create _inference API, and GET _inference API) to `parameters`. Users are asked to update any code accessing or creating `task_settings` to use `parameters` instead. Support for requests and responses including `task_settings` will be removed in 9.0.
  impact: The inference API is maintaing backwards compatibility until 9.0, but we now recommend replacing usages of `task_settings` with `parameters`.
